## Installation

### Automatic

Run the command in your terminal:
```bash
curl -s https://git.io/Jvrt7 | sudo sh 13.2
```
The script required a user password for copying a folder into Xcode.app.

### Manual

1. Clone the repo
2. Unzip `13.2.zip` 
3. Copy unzipped folder into `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport`.

❗️Don't forget to restart Xcode.
